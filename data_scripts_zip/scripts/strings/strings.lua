*** NOTICE TO WRITERS ***
- Please use Canadian standard English.


***************************************************************
*** NOTICE TO TRANSLATORS: DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY! ***

We have a standard PO file for translation in ../../localizations/strings.pot

To locally modify our translations, create a local translation mod:
1. Find the game install directory. (Open Steam, right click Rotwood, Manage > Browse local files)
2. In samplemods.zip, find mods/sampletranslation and follow the steps in the README.md.txt file.


***************************************************************
*** FOR OFFICIAL LANGUAGES ***

To add a new official language:
1. The PO file goes in ../../localizations/ and it needs a Localization script
   in ../localizations/. Be sure the po_filenames field matches your po file.
2. Use ../../translation/run_gui.bat to run our translation pipeline.

To update the .pot file for translators:
1. Run ../../../updateprefabs.bat
   (The buildmachine runs this automatically before builds.)

***************************************************************
*** NOTICE TO CODERS ***
- Use subfmt for variables in strings in instead of %s. It helps translators
  understand context and translation mistakes won't cause crashes.
